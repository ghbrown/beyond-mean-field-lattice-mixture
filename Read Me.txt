STUFF TO KEEP IN MIND (PERHAPS FOR WRITING UP THIS PAPER):
    E_microstate=N_nnpMicrostate*U(cellwidth)
    Q=sum_microstates[W_microstate*exp(-Beta*N_nnpMicrostate*U(cellwidth))]
    let Beta*U(cellWidth)=C, some constant which characterizes the ratio of the
        attraction between atoms to the thermal energy
    must represent the internal energy as a ratio of the internal energy to U(cellWidth)
        since U(cellWidth) is not specified, only C
